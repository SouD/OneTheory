#OneTheory
By SouD

Version: 0.1

Date: 13/02/2013

##Description
OneTheory will be a Java application that will simulate a bossfight on a MangosOne server
so that you can see what kind of dps output you would do with the input stats. It will also
allow you to play around with gear setups and talents, as well as raid buffs and the such.
Furthermore I intend for it to be pretty flexible so that it will work for several different
classes this time, unlike its predescessor ZeroTheory.

##Downloading
To clone OneTheory use the following command: git clone git://github.com/SouD/Onetheory.git
or download repo as .zip

##Usage
TBW.

##Disclaimer
This is a work in progress as well as being extremly early in its development. This means that the
project may radically change between commits.

###On DBCs
You must supply your own set of DBC files since I'm currently unsure about the legality of re-distributing them.
To get your own set, fork or download the MangosOne project and use the ad.exe application in the /contrib/ folder.

**List of needed DBCS:**
TBW.
